Hello everybody, in this article I will talk about my new blog which is called **iSmooth Star**, describing the technologies I am using to host it, the history behind it and why I chose **Jekyll** to run it.

## Abouth iSmooth Star
This blog is hosted using different technologies and services that I am mainly utilizing to serve it to the internet.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is the main blogging software.
- [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) as the theme of my blog.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the blog.
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) obviously for the domain name.

Of course, if we talk about the technologies that each one of these is built on, then the list will go on much further.

I am going to discuss a lot of topics related to technology here and there, I built a homelab with my servers and network equipment I have acquired throughout the years. So, the topics that this blog will cover will mostly be:

- Computers, including but not limited to all types of servers and single board computers.
- Networks, spefically the software and hardware used for networks.
- Operating Systems, will most likely be `Linux` and maybe `Windows` or others from time to time.

That may not only be it, I will definitely find a way to discover more topics in my journey as a blogger but that's what I currently have in mind.

## My Past History and Experience
Actually, this is not my first attempt at blogging, I started my first blog on 2012 when it was so special to be a blogger. In fact, it's still running ever since to this date but it's the blog that I left behind because of how outdated and limited the platform that I was using to host it.

So, it's no secret, you can visit my old blog on [ismoothblog.com](https://www.ismoothblog.com/) where you can find many outdated articles. Also, I had some other small blogs but it's not worth mentioning right now.

Moreover, I was mostly familliar with [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) known as **Blogspot** as my platform of choice at that time for **iSmooth Blog** and my other blogs. I have some experience with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) but for some reason I never really migrated to it even though it was superior I sticked to `Blogger` maybe because I didn't want to pay for hosting and maintaining `Wordpress`.

At one point, I had bought a **VPS** plan where I hosted many side projects for development purposes, and I happened to have `Wordpress` installed on some sites and I played with it for a long time then I discovered `Jekyll` and installed it on the same instance that's when it all started. After all, it has been years since I tinkered with blogging software and I fianlly decided to launch **iSmooth Star** using `Jekyll` which is currently running on this site.

Furthermore, the reason that I didn't just migrate my old blog to `Jekyll` and started from where I stopped is that as I said, most of the articles there are really outdated so it's not worth the effort and it's much better to make a fresh start.

Therefore, I plan to keep **iSmooth Blog** running on `Blogger` for now because it has a trusty 12 years old domain which I might use with some other project in the future.

## Why Jekyll
Well, this question will most likely be based on how `Blogger` and maybe `Wordpress` failed to meet my expectations or fit my liking.

### Blogger Disadvantages
- You don't own your blog, meaning once blogger decides to shutdown or delete your blog then it's over.
- You are limited by their own terms and conditions.
- You can't freely customize your blog it's very limited.
- Very poor SEO performance.
- It doesn't look professional.

### Wordpress Disadvantages
- Cost! Yes, it is the main reason for me not to use it.
- Security risks that can arise because of outdated plugins or software.
- You must keep updating it with backups.
- It's slow because at its core, it's built dynamically on many technologies.
- Requires a lot of effort for maintenance.

### Jekyll Advantages
Now, lets talk about why **Jekyll** looks attractive to me with my experience in comprison to these two.

- It's open source and free to host on **GitHub Pages**.
- It's a static site generator with all of its benefits.
- It's secure and it doesn't need to be updated.
- It's blazing fast to load static pages unlike dynamic sites.
- Full control and customizability over everything.

Additionally, **Jekyll** addresses for me all the drawbacks of **Blogger** that's used for hosting my old blog. Okay, I am not going to talk about the disadvantesg of Jekyll for now, although we'll find out very soon.

## Conclusion
I would say it's all about the experience, if you don't have experience with development and code then **Jekyll** may not be the definite choice for your new blog.

If you are all about speed and security then it may be the way to go with static site generators like Jekyll and many others. For instance, if you are moving away from **Blogger** then you are defnitely on the right track.
