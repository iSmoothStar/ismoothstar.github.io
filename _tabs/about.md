## Author
Hello there, I am the author of this blog and my name is **Saleem**, I consider myself as an IT Expert, Hacker, Developer and Blogger. I have always been in love with technology which is the knowledge that I am seeking for. I like everything about computers, networks, servers and operating systems.

## About iSmooth Star
This blog is hosted using different technologies and services that I am mainly utilizing to serve it to the internet.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is the main blogging software.
- [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) as the theme of my blog.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the blog.
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) obviously for the domain name.

Of course, if we talk about the technologies that each one of these is built on, then the list will go on much further.

I am going to discuss a lot of topics related to technology here and there, I have built a homelab with my servers and network equipment I acquired throughout the years. So, the topics that this blog will cover will mostly be:

- Computers, including but not limited to all types of servers and single board computers.
- Networks, spefically the software and hardware used for networks.
- Operating Systems, will most likely be `Linux` and maybe `Windows` or others from time to time.

That may not only be it, I will definitely find a way to discover more topics in my journey as a blogger but that's what I currently have in mind.

## My Past History and Experience
Actually, this is not my first attempt at blogging, I started my first blog on 2012 when it was so special to be a blogger. In fact, it's still running ever since to this date but it's the blog that I left behind because of how outdated and limited the platform that I was using to host it.

So, it's no secret, you can visit my old blog on [ismoothblog.com](https://www.ismoothblog.com/) where you can find many outdated articles. Also, I had some other small blogs but it's not worth mentioning right now.

Moreover, I was mostly familliar with [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) known as **Blogspot** as my platform of choice at that time for **iSmooth Blog** and my other blogs. I have some experience with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) but for some reason I never really migrated to it even though it was superior I sticked to `Blogger` maybe because I didn't want to pay for hosting and maintaining `Wordpress`.

At one point, I had bought a **VPS** plan where I hosted many side projects for development purposes, and I happened to have `Wordpress` installed on some sites and I played with it for a long time then I discovered `Jekyll` and installed it on the same instance that's when it all started. After all, it has been years since I tinkered with blogging software and I fianlly decided to launch **iSmooth Star** on 2024 using `Jekyll` which is currently running on this site.

Furthermore, the reason that I didn't just migrate my old blog to `Jekyll` and started from where I stopped is that as I said, most of the articles there are really outdated so it's not worth the effort and it's much better to make a fresh start.

Therefore, I plan to keep **iSmooth Blog** running on `Blogger` for now because it has a trusty 12 years old domain which I might use with some other project in the future.
